## Learn Something New Tab Extension
This project is a new tab extension that brings together the Syfy Bad Astronomy feed by Phil Plait and PBS SpaceTime youtube channel by Matt O'Dowd into a single place with the option to view the APOD as the background. A default image is provided as a background for ease of use.
## How to install
1. Download all files associated with this project into a single folder.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in a new tab.
3. Ensure `Developer mode` is enabled.
4. Click on `Load Unpacked`
5. Select the folder you saved the files in.
6. When opening a new tab, verify that the tab is what you expected to see by clicking on `Keep Settings`.
## Known issues and TODO list
1. ~~The extension currently has an error on the rss2json js link. Planned exploration if this external library is necessary to allow the Bad Astronomy feed to work. Left in at this time as the feed works.~~
2. ~~TODO: Update link colors for readability~~
3. TODO: Add back in some of the default tab functioning
   - Gmail, image, and other links
   - Speed dial/frequently visited pages
4. TODO: Add weather API
5. TODO: Add time/date
